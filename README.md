# Electronic Signature
[OpenOTP Security Suite](https://www.rcdevs.com/downloads/download/?file=Enterprise%2Fwebadm_all_in_one) (edited by [RCDevs Security](https://www.rcdevs.com/)) combined with our [Nextcloud plugin](https://www.rcdevs.com/downloads/download/?file=Plugins%2FOpenOTP_NextCloud_Sign) allows you to sign (standard or advanced e-signatures) and/or seal documents within your organization (between colleagues). Workflow requests are received through Push Notifications on your mobile through the [OpenOTP Token App](https://www.rcdevs.com/products/openotp-token-app/). Once the document is signed, it can be found in that same folder in Nextcloud.
